#Connected shape management library
#This project is a library for managing 'connected shapes': You can change the parameters of a shape by connecting it to an available shape and calculate the area of the shape or the total area of the connected shape.
#The library includes connected shapes: it contains a list of connected configurations and managed shapes
Connected shapes include:
  Single circle shapes: can only handle a single circle shape
  Single square shape: can only handle a single square shape
  Multiple Shapes: can handle multiple shapes of different shape types
#Connection Configuration: It has connection configurations.
#Shapes: It has logic and functions about how to manipulate shapes. But does not know any information about the connection.
#Limitations: A shape must be connected in order to change parameters or calculate area.
